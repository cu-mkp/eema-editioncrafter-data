# eema-data

This project will build a valuable tool for examining these topics by transcribing and translating works by the polymath Walther Hermann Ryff (ca. 1500-1548), whose medical, scientific, and architectural energies converged in a set of architectural treatises with deep ramifications for Europe and colonial Latin America. Far from being merely 'bookish', these texts represented a treasury of practical and learned knowledge available at the time. Ryff, himself a product of the mining cultures of the Ore mountains, likewise drew on the experience of the Habsburg Empire's colonies across the Atlantic; this makes his writings a fascinating digest of how European architecture and science were extending their global reach. Ryff's assemblage of ideas, texts, images, and reports, all set in thousands of pages of early print, will allow us to reconstruct complex disciplinary relationships and global knowledge networks. Although Ryff's architectural contributions are widely known to have a singular place in the growth of early modern science, this will be the first systematic project to analyse them, make them widely available, and set them in a global, colonial narrative. 




## editioncrafter-data repository

This repository is a template repository for users who plan to use EditionCrafter to create their editions. It contains the basic structure and organization of the files needed as input for the creation of the "folios view" element: the side-by-side viewing panes of the text, where users can choose between versions of the text including facsimile images, transcribed text, and translated text. All associated metadata is also to be housed in this repository.

> Example of the "folios view," with side-by-side viewing panes of [fol. 4r](https://edition640.makingandknowing.org/#/folios/4r/f/4r/tl) of BnF Ms. Fr. 640 in *Secrets of Craft and Nature*.


## How-tos

Because this repository may be used by beginners, a number of helpful how-tos have been included:
- [Introduction to Git and Github](how-tos/intro-to-github.md)
- [Naming Protocols](how-tos/naming-protocols.md)
- [Setting up Github to Work Locally & General Workflow](how-tos/github-local-setup-and-workflow.md)
- [Command Line Intro and Helpful Commands](how-tos/command-line.md)
- [Project Setup Overview](how-tos/project-setup.md) - reference for project developers

## Repository Structure

This repository has two main areas: 
1. [texts/](texts/) directory - all files associated with an edition's source material (i.e., transcriptions and translations)
2. [metadata/](metadata/) directory - all metadata (data about data) associated with an edition

This is based upon the model used for the creation of *Secrets of Craft and Nature*. M&K's repository for BnF Ms. Fr. 640’s data is [cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data](https://github.com/cu-mkp/m-k-manuscript-data) and the “read me” file (scroll down below the file and directory listings on the repo's homepage) describes the repo's structure and how M&K has already worked with Github for *Secrets of Craft and Nature*.
